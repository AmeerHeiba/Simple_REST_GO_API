# üß™ Go Minimal REST API Server

This is a minimal HTTP server written purely using Go's **standard library**, showcasing how to build a basic RESTful API with no external dependencies.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Built using only `net/http` (no frameworks)
- Thread-safe in-memory user storage with `sync.RWMutex`
- RESTful endpoints:
  - `GET /user/{id}` ‚Äì Get user by ID
  - `POST /user` ‚Äì Create new user
  - `DELETE /user/{id}` ‚Äì Delete user by ID
- Go 1.22+ route pattern matching (e.g. `/user/{id}`)

---

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (>= 1.22)
- **Storage:** In-memory map with mutex locking
- **Frameworks:** None

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher

### Running the Server

```bash
go run main.go
```

Server will start at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## üì° API Endpoints

### `GET /`
Returns a simple welcome message.

**Response:**
```
Hello Client!
```

---

### `POST /user`

Creates a new user.

**Request Header:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Ameer"
}
```

**Responses:**
- `202 Accepted` ‚Äì User successfully created
- `400 Bad Request` ‚Äì Invalid or empty name

---

### `GET /user/{id}`

Fetches a user by ID.

**Example:**
```
GET /user/1
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Ameer"
}
```

**Responses:**
- `200 OK` ‚Äì User found
- `400 Bad Request` ‚Äì Invalid ID
- `404 Not Found` ‚Äì User not found

---

### `DELETE /user/{id}`

Deletes a user by ID.

```

**Responses:**
- `204 No Content` ‚Äì User deleted
- `400 Bad Request` ‚Äì Invalid ID
- `404 Not Found` ‚Äì User not found

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Data is stored in-memory (non-persistent)
- No input sanitization beyond basic validation
- Meant for experimentation, not production

---

## üß† Why This Project?

This example demonstrates:

- How to build an HTTP server with Go‚Äôs standard library
- RESTful route handling in Go 1.22+
- Basic concurrency-safe in-memory data operations
